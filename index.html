<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The source-tree is separated into several classes for convenience:</p>

<h3>dynamicTopoFvMesh</h3>

<p>Mesh class that extends dynamicFvMesh functionality to handle dynamic simplical meshes, which consist of        triangle prisms in 2D, and tetrahedra in 3D. Adaptation is driven mainly by mesh-quality and mesh refinement criteria. When used in combination with mesh-smoothing methods, this functionality is expected to suit situations where domain deformation characteristics are not known a-priori. Conservative solution remapping after mesh reconnection is performed automatically. Parallel functionality is also included.</p>

<h3>fluxCorrector</h3>

<p>Auxiliary library which is used by dynamicTopoFvMesh to perform a correction to velocity fluxes after mesh reconnection.</p>

<h3>mesquiteMotionSolver</h3>

<p>Class that provides a general interface to the Mesquite mesh smoothing library from Sandia National Labs.       The class also performs smoothing for surface meshes using a spring-analogy approach, and is known to work in parallel.</p>

<h3>conservativeMeshToMesh</h3>

<p>Conservative mesh-to-mesh interpolation class.</p>

<h3>mapConservativeFields</h3>

<p>Field-mapping utility that works in a manner similar to mapFields in OpenFOAM, using the conservativeMeshToMesh class as a back end. This utility is currently not designed to work in parallel.</p>

<h2>Target platform</h2>

<p>The master branch is known to work with OpenFOAM-extend.
To compile with the OpenFOAM-2.1.x release, switch to the Port-2.1.x branch.</p>
