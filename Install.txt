Installation instructions:
-------------------------

Pre-installation steps:

Ensure that OpenFOAM-extend is installed and properly configured.

Repository check-out and installation:

 1. Checkout the repository contents to an appropriate location on disk:

    git clone https://github.com/smenon/dynamicTopoFvMesh <check-out directory>

    or, if you're having trouble with the https protocol, 
    you can alternatively do it through SSH:

    git clone git@ssh.github.com:smenon/dynamicTopoFvMesh <check-out directory>

 2. Go to the checked-out directory and type:

    ./Allwmake

 3. This will build the relevant libraries / executables, and place them in 
    $FOAM_USER_LIBBIN / $FOAM_USER_APPBIN.

Usage:

 1. To use the updated library, place the following line in your dynamicMeshDict:

    dynamicFvMeshLibs       ("libdynamicTopoFvMesh.so");
    motionSolverLibs        ("libmesquiteMotionSolver.so");

 2. Since this is an updated repository version, use the following entries:

    dynamicFvMesh           dynamicTopoFvMesh-git;
    solver                  mesquiteMotionSolver-git;
