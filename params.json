Adaptation is driven mainly by mesh-quality and mesh refinement criteria. When used in combination with mesh-smoothing methods, this functionality is expected to suit situations where domain deformation characteristics are not known a-priori. Conservative solution remapping after mesh reconnection is performed automatically. Parallel functionality is also included.\r\n\r\n### fluxCorrector\r\nAuxiliary library which is used by dynamicTopoFvMesh to perform a correction to velocity fluxes after mesh reconnection.\r\n\r\n### mesquiteMotionSolver\r\nClass that provides a general interface to the Mesquite mesh smoothing library from Sandia National Labs.       The class also performs smoothing for surface meshes using a spring-analogy approach, and is known to work in parallel.\r\n\r\n### conservativeMeshToMesh\r\nConservative mesh-to-mesh interpolation class.\r\n\r\n### mapConservativeFields\r\nField-mapping utility that works in a manner similar to mapFields in OpenFOAM, using the conservativeMeshToMesh class as a back end. This utility is currently not designed to work in parallel.\r\n\r\n## Target platform\r\nThe master branch is known to work with OpenFOAM-extend.\r\nTo compile with the OpenFOAM-2.1.x release, switch to the Port-2.1.x branch.\r\n\r\n## Author\r\n    Sandeep Menon\r\n    University of Massachusetts Amherst\r\n\r\n## Disclaimer\r\nThis offering is not approved or endorsed by ESI or OpenCFD Ltd, the producer of the OpenFOAM software and owner of the OpenFOAM and OpenCFD trade marks.\r\n","google":"UA-37250769-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
