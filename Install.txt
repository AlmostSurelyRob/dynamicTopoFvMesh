Installation instructions:
-------------------------

Pre-installation steps:

 1. Ensure that OpenFOAM is installed and properly configured.

 2. Configure and install Mesquite.

    - Obtain the sources from:
      http://www.cs.sandia.gov/optimization/knupp/Software.htm

    - Follow installation instructions and compile Mesquite.

    - Assuming that Mesquite is installed in $WM_THIRD_PARTY_DIR,
      define the following environment variables:

      In Bash:
        export MESQUITE_DIR=$WM_THIRD_PARTY_DIR/mesquite-x.x.x

      In Csh:
        setenv MESQUITE_DIR $WM_THIRD_PARTY_DIR/mesquite-x.x.x

    - Add the Mesquite lib directory to the library path:

      In Bash:
        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$MESQUITE_DIR/lib

      In Csh:
        setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:${MESQUITE_DIR}/lib

Repository check-out and installation:

 1. Checkout the repository contents to an appropriate location on disk:

    git clone https://github.com/smenon/dynamicTopoFvMesh <check-out directory>

    or, if you're having trouble with the https protocol,
    you can alternatively do it through SSH:

    git clone git@ssh.github.com:smenon/dynamicTopoFvMesh <check-out directory>

 2. Go to the checked-out directory and type:

    ./Allwmake

 3. This will build the relevant libraries / executables, and place them in
    $FOAM_USER_LIBBIN / $FOAM_USER_APPBIN.

Usage:

 1. To use the libraries, add the following lines in your dynamicMeshDict:

    dynamicFvMeshLibs       ("libdynamicTopoFvMesh.so");
    motionSolverLibs        ("libmesquiteMotionSolver.so");
